## User Feedback for Stock Hawk:
### Hellen says:
*"Right now I can't use this app with my screen reader. My friends love it, so I would love to download it, but the buttons don't tell my screen reader what they do."*

### Your boss says:
*"We need to prepare Stock Hawk for the Egypt release. Make sure our translators know what to change and make sure the Arabic script will format nicely."*

### Adebowale says:
*"Stock Hawk allows me to track the current price of stocks, but to track their prices over time, I need to use an external program. It would be wonderful if you could show more detail on a stock, including its price over time."*

### Gundega says:
*"I use a lot of widgets on my Android device, and I would love to have a widget that displays my stock quotes on my home screen."*

### Jamal says:
*"I found a bug in your app. Right now when I search for a stock quote that doesn't exist, the app crashes."*

### Xaio-lu says:
*"When I opened this app for the first time without a network connection, it was a confusing blank screen. I would love a message that tells me why the screen is blank or whether my stock quotes are out of date."*
